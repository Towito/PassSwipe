# PassSwipe
Mobile application that brings those in need of a meal swipe to a person that can donate one. Current plan is to start with the UMass Amherst campus


Will require users to be near a dining common. The whole point is to make it as smooth as possible. FOr example, if I'm already near Hamp and it turns out someone needs a swipe, I can arrive at Hamp and only wait a few minutes for someone to show up so i can pass a swipe to them. Alternatively, I can be eating at Hamp already and just come up to the front and swipe them in.

Needs to authenticate with a genuine UMass email.


Main questions so far are:
  - Which language to use?
  - Which framework with that language?
  
  -How will I organize users?
  -What platforms do I want this on?
  -UI????? What are these screens looking like?
  -verify users through faces? How do you store that data?
